### Improvements
- chats can be stored to db using mongoose ORM.

### Deployment
- ws for local development
- wss for production
- "start": "node server.js"
2. Deploying to Render
Deploying the WebSocket Server
Create a Render Account: If you don’t have one, sign up for Render.

Connect to GitHub: Render integrates with GitHub for deployments. Ensure your WebSocket server code is in a GitHub repository.

Create a New Web Service on Render:

Go to the Render dashboard and click on “New” and select “Web Service.”
Connect your GitHub repository to Render.
Select the repository containing your WebSocket server code.
Render will detect your package.json and configure the build and start commands automatically.
Configure Environment Variables (if needed):

Set environment variables such as PORT if required.
Deploy: Click “Create Web Service” to start the deployment. Render will automatically build and deploy your server. You’ll get a public URL for your WebSocket server.

Deploying the Front-End
Prepare Front-End for Deployment:

If you're using a static site (e.g., plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript), ensure it’s ready for deployment.
Create a New Static Site on Render:

Go to the Render dashboard and click on “New” and select “Static Site.”
Connect your GitHub repository containing your front-end code.
Configure the build and publish directories if needed.
Set Up Your Static Site:

Render will automatically detect static site settings.
Ensure your front-end code points to the correct WebSocket URL provided by Render.
Deploy: Click “Create Static Site” to deploy. Render will build and deploy your static site, and you'll get a public URL for your front-end.

3. Update WebSocket URL in Front-End
Make sure to update the WebSocket URL in your front-end code to the URL provided by Render for your WebSocket server.

In your front-end code (index.html):

javascript
Copy code
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-render-websocket-server.onrender.com');
Replace 'wss://your-render-websocket-server.onrender.com' with the actual URL provided by Render.
