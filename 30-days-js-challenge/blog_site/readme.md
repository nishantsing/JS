## Creating Static Blog Site

- We have used simple html js css.
- If you want to add more posts keep adding the posts.html and a template in posts.json.
- more improvement can be to send a link for subscription to users using email services.
- try using more robust and cleaner techniques like:

    1. Template Engines

    2. Static Site Generator (SSG):

    - Jekyll (works well with GitHub Pages)
    - Hugo (fast and flexible)
    - Gatsby (React-based)
    - Eleventy (simple and powerful)

- also try to deploy them on services which enable to deploy static  sites, github pages, netlify, vercel.
- also can  use other deployment services such as render, glitch, fly, railway, heroku, AWS, GCP.
